We will analyze IMDb data to gain a better understanding of the factors that make movies well received by their audiences. These results can be used by movie producers and film companies to better understand the factors needed to create a great movie, as well as by the audiences to better predict if certain movies are worth watching.\n",

In the initial dataset, there are 7,668 records and 15 attributes (some categorical, some continuous).\n",

    "The xxx model had the lowest MAE and RMSE, and is thus the best model to use for prediciting scores based off Movie Industry dataset attributes. However, even the best model performed poorly, which indicates that it is difficult to use this dataset's features to predict scores. Some solutions that may improve our model's ability to make accurate predicitions could be to increase the number of records in the dataset in order to make trends in the data more apparent. Having a better balanced dataset could also help.\n",
