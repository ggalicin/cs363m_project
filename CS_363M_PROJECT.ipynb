We will analyze IMDb data to gain a better understanding of the factors that make movies well received by their audiences. These results can be used by movie producers and film companies to better understand the factors needed to create a great movie, as well as by the audiences to better predict if certain movies are worth watching.\n",

In the initial dataset, there are 7,668 records and 15 attributes (some categorical, some continuous).\n",
