We will analyze IMDb data to gain a better understanding of the factors that make movies well received by their audiences.

In the initial dataset, there are 7,668 records and 15 attributes (some categorical, some continuous).\n",

    "Overall, the SVR model had the highest R2 and lowest MAE and RMSE, and is thus the best model to use for predicting scores based off Movie Industry data. The higher R2 indicates that we got the best fit between our observations and predictions by using SVR (aka 42% of the variation in our features could be explained by score in the SVR model). We also used MAE and RMSE to measure accuracy for continuous variables. The MAE indicates that, on average, we had an absolute difference of 0.55 between our actual and predicted scores when using SVR. The RMSE indicates that the square root of the average of squared differences between our actual and predicted scores was 0.73 with SVR. Given that our target variable ranged from 0 to 10 and had one decimal place, these metrics show that SVR predicted scores fairly well. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "After SVR, MLPRegressor did second best (it was only slightly worse than SVR), followed by linear regression and then KNeighborsRegressor.\n",
    "<br><br> \n",
    "One caveat is that our data was not very well balanced (since most of our data tended to have scores between 5 and 8), and thus our prediction accuracy will likely be lower for a balanced dataset. However, our decision tree did use SMOTE to balance the dataset more, and still performed decently with an average difference of 0.92 between actual and predicted scores.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "One way we could improve our models' abilities to make accurate predictions would be to increase the number of records in the dataset in order to make trends in the data more apparent. Having a more well balanced initial dataset would also help. Additionally, we could merge the current dataset with other datasets that contain additional attributes about our movies in order to add more relevant features to our dataset.\n",
